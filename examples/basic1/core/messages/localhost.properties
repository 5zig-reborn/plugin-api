# This file contains all messages that should be listened on.
# This is accomplished by using regex patterns. When a pattern matches a server message, the
# onMatch() method of all registered AbstractGameListeners will be called, together with the key
# of the pattern and the match result. You can use round brackets to specify a match group that
# will be accessible in this IPatternResult.
# Some expressions are already pre-defined and will be replaced by the mod: %p will match any valid
# Minecraft player name, %d will match any (positive or negative) integer.

lobby=You are now on server lobby (.+)

# Messages of the game mode "dummy" prefixed with "dl."
dl.start=The dummy game has started!
dl.end=The dummy game has ended!
